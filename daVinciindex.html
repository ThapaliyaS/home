			<h1>Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
			<p>
			Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was an Italian Renaissance artist, scientist, inventor, and polymath. He is widely considered to be one of the most diversely talented individuals to have ever lived.
			Da Vinci is perhaps best known for his iconic paintings, such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. However, he was also a skilled engineer and inventor, and is credited with designing prototypes for many modern machines and devices.
			In addition to his artistic and engineering pursuits, da Vinci was also a keen observer of the natural world. He conducted numerous scientific studies and experiments, and his notebooks contain detailed sketches and diagrams of everything from human anatomy to flying machines.
			Da Vinci&apos;s legacy continues to inspire and captivate people around the world today, nearly 500 years after his death.
